//Suppose there is a base class B and a derived class D derived from  B. B has two public member functions b1( ) and b2( ), whereas D has two member functions d1( ) and d2( ). Write these classes for the following different situations: b1( ) should be accessible in main( ), b2( ) should not be. Neither b1( ), nor b2( ) should be accessible in main( ). Both b1( ) and b2( ) should be accessible in main( ).
