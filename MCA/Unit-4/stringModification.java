/*
As string object are immutable we have to copy a string into StringBuffer whenever we need to
modify it. We can also use some predefined string methods; it will construct a modified copy of
the string and returns the same. Methods which we can use for the purpose are stated below: 
substring()
This method is used to extract a substring from the given string. There are two types of substring.
The first one is:
String substring(int startIndex); 
Where the startIndex defines the starting point of the substring that is to be extracted from the
given string. 
The second type is:
String substring(int startIndex, int endIndex); 
Here we mention both the starting index and the end index.
